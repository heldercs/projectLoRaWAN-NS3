# projectLoRaWAN

This project is an ns-3 module that can be used to perform simulations of a LoRaWAN network, and it is based in the initial version of this code was developed as part of a master's thesis at the University of Padova, under the supervision of Prof. Lorenzo Vangelista, Prof. Michele Zorzi and with the help of Marco Centenaro.

## Getting Started ##

This section is aimed at getting a user to a working state starting with a machine that may never have had LoRaWAN-NS3 installed. It covers prerequisites, ways to obtain LoRaWAN-NS3, ways to build LoRaWAN-NS3, and ways to verify your build and run LoRaWAN program.

### Prerequisites ###
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y install gcc g++ python
$ sudo apt-get -y install gcc g++ python python-dev
$ sudo apt-get -y install qt4-dev-tools libqt4-dev
$ sudo apt-get -y install mercurial
$ sudo apt-get -y install bzr
$ sudo apt-get -y install cmake libc6-dev libc6-dev-i386 g++-multilib
$ sudo apt-get -y install gdb valgrind
$ sudo apt-get -y install gsl-bin libgsl2 libgsl2:i386
$ sudo apt-get -y install flex bison libfl-dev
$ sudo apt-get -y install tcpdump
$ sudo apt-get -y install sqlite sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
$ sudo apt-get -y install libxml2 libxml2-dev
$ sudo apt-get -y install libgtk2.0-0 libgtk2.0-dev
$ sudo apt-get -y install vtun lxc
$ sudo apt-get -y install git
```
### Downloading LoRaWAN-NS3 ###

Letâ€™s assume that you, as a user, wish to build LoRaWAN-NS3 in a local directory called Workspace. If you adopt the Workspace directory approach, you can get a copy of a release by typing the following into your Linux shell:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/heldercs/projectLoRaWAN-NS3
```
### Building LoRaWAN-NS3 ###

To configure the LoRaWAN-NS3 you will need to execute the following commands:
```
$ ./waf configure --build-profile=debug --enable-examples --enable-tests
```
The build system is now configured and you can build the debug versions of the LoRaWAN-NS3 programs by simply typing
```
$ ./waf
```
